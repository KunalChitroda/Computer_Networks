        "Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an error-detection technique used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. CRC operates by appending a short, fixed-length binary sequence (called the CRC code) to the end of a data block. This code is computed based on the original data and a generator polynomial agreed upon by the sender and receiver. At the receiver's end, the CRC code is recomputed and compared with the transmitted code to check for errors."
